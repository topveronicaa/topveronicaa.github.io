<div class='work'>
<div class='par work first'>Time does fly. I've been working for more than 3 months before I knew it. It's my first time working as a developer in a real technical company, and I was more than nervous at the very start and now have almost been gotten used to working and developing. And now It's almost the middle of December and around time to say goodbye to my first job as Full Stack Web Developer at Knowledgehook and all my kind and helpful collegues at the company.</div>
<div class='par work'> If I trace back to the last three/four months, it has been a time in my life when I felt most fulfilling as a developer. I could feel myself growing stronger and refinning as a university student, as a future developer, as a female who has bigger dreams about herself and her career and as myself. I faced numerous challenges in aspects of programming languages and website development and fought my way to understand them and work with them. I solved countless problems regarding communication, cooperation and so on. And now, near the end of this term, I could confidently and proudly say I has become much better and capable person and I'm ready for the challenges approaching in my life. </div>
<p class='sub work'> PART 1: What I actually did during this job?</p>
<p class='work'> 1. Contributed to two releases. </p>
<div class='par work'>The first release was a bit more than a month and second one was a bit less than a month. I finished all my tasks and even worked on extra tickets after I finished my task queue. As a whole I finished about 20 features as well as spent 3 weeks fixing automated scripts, which went into the second release. </div>
<div class='work'> I Finished tasks and features according to the specs given by my boss. Some of them are new features including building new back-end or front-end controllers and adding new table or records in database. Others are revising or refining existing features to improve use experience or enhance performance. One of my favorite features is shared folders, which allowed users to shared folders with others and view them / edit them.</div>
<p class='work'> 2. Rewrite project</p>
<div class='par work'>I participated in the rewriting project during my first month or so. The exisiting website is based on AngularJS and my boss believed some performance issues were caused by the framework. Since Angular 2 and TypeScript have been out and stablized, I was responsible for rewriting the exsiting codes into the new Angular 2 framework.</div>
<div class='par work'>I didn't finished the whole rewrite of website and was given the features to work on, which improved the existing production website. The reason was that somehow we found out most of the performance issues were caused by inappropriate logics or codings, instead of the language or framework itself. Then the rewrite project was postponed and we focused on improving the current website</div>
<p class='work'> 3. Automated testing</p>
<div class='par work'>Our company had a series of automated tests in Protractor finished by former employers. Since we have changed the UI and codes dramatically somehow, the codes were not working well. There were around 40 testing specs and I worked on them to make them work. The fixed took me around 3 weeks because of the dramatic changed made. </div>
<div class='par work'>I also fixed the subscription functionalities of the dev website. I set up new Xero account for testing and updated the existing private and public keys.</div>
<p class='sub work'> PART 2: What technical things did I learn?</p>
<div class='par work'> A list of all new languages or frameworks I learnt: (yes I learnt from scratch about web development and basically everything!)</div>
<div class='work'>AngularJS, Angular 2, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, SQL, Entity Framework, Protractor</div>
<p class='sub work'> PART 3: Several stories to remember/ What life skills did I learn?</p>
