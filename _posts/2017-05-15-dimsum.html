<h1>Everything About Chinese Tea Brunch (1)</h1>
<p>Chinese Dim Sum, the small and delicate dishes of dumplings, cakes, etc, are now popolar among different occasions and different people. In China, however, Dim Sum is much more than just a snack. Dim Sum, together with Tea, forms Chinese Tea Brunch. As well as a great cuision, Tea Brunch has became an essential part of traditional Chinese culture.</p>
<h2 class = "dim">History</h2>
<p>Dim Sum are most popular in southern part of China, such us GuangZhou city. The reason of this phenomenon traces back to 1700s.</p>
<p>In 1757(Qing Dynasty), GuangZhou became the only spot that could bear international tradings in China. As a result, numerous Chinese goods(tea, silk..) were transported to GuangZhou and thousands of foreign goods sent from GuangZhou to the rest of China. The prosperaty of trading in GuangZhou made residents rich. Being rich, they thought more about eating for living. They wanted to enjoy.</p>
<p>So they created something that could embedded eating into drinking and chatting. THis was the strat of Tea Brunch. But at that time, Dim Sum in Tea Brunch were not so much and for normal residents, the most popular Tea Brunch is "one tea, two Dim Sum", which allowed business and family to seat down, drink some cups of tea and have two dishes of Dim Sum. </p>
<h2 class = "dim">Culture</h2>
<p>Tea Brunch is not only about eating. There are numerous courtesy behind a tea burnch.</p>
<p>With the rising of the sun, Mr. and Mrs Wang(65), together with several of their neighbours, go to LiangXiang Diner for their routine Tea Brunch. These elderly people are normally the earsiest at a Tea Brunch Restaurant. Their main forcus is on tea, newspapers and some morning talks. Everytime the Wangs and their neighbours have their routine seats and routine table.</p>
<p>After the tea is served, Mr. Wang uses tea water to clean the cups, bowels and plates and puts the waste water into the plastic box on the table. This is not something particular about Mr. Wang. This is what most Tea Bruncher would do before they have the tea.</p>
<p>They have tea, reading newpapers and chat. Dim Sum are usually served with carts. Each cart has different Dim Sum and the carts are pushed around the diner and around each table. Mr. and Mrs. Wang do not have particular things to do, they normally stay until 10 a.m. and leave to the grocery market.</p>
<p>With the departing of the elders come the younger. They usually come here for family dinning or classmate together. For them, this is literally Tea Brunch. They eat much more than the elders and would stay after noon. </p>
<p>Despite the name, Tea Brunch is more like "all day breakfast". It is normally served all the time in the day. In the afternoon or at night, businessman could come with their clients and family could come with relatives.</p>
