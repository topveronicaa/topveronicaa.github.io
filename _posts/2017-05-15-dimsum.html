<p>Chinese Dim Sum, the small and delicate dishes of dumplings, cakes, etc, are now popular among different occasions and different people. 
  With just a serve of one or two pieces, Dim Sum would give lots of pleasure and joy, whether after a tedious meeting or during a cheerful event.
  In China, however, Dim Sum is much more than just a snack. 
  Dim Sum, together with Tea, forms Chinese Tea Brunch. 
  As well as a great brunch, Tea Brunch has become an essential part of traditional Chinese culture.</p>
<h2 class = "dim">History</h2>
<p>Dim Sum are most popular in the southern parts of China, one of which is GuangZhou city. 
  The reason of this phenomenon traces back to 1700s.</p>
<p>In 1757(Qing Dynasty), GuangZhou became the only spot that could bear international tradings in China. 
  As a result, numerous Chinese goods(tea, silk..) were transported to GuangZhou and thousands of foreign goods sent from GuangZhou to the rest of China. 
  The prosperity of trading in GuangZhou made residents there wealthy. Being wealthy, they thought less about eating for living. They wanted to enjoy.</p>
<p>So they created something that could embed eating into drinking and chatting. 
  This was the strat of Tea Brunch. 
  But at that time, for normal residents, the most popular Tea Brunch was "one tea, two Dim Sum", 
  which only included one cup of tea and two dishes of Dim Sum. </p>
<h2 class = "dim">Culture</h2>
<p>In southern cities like GuangZhou, Tea Brunch is the most popular activity among all ages of people.</p>
<p>With the rising of sun, Mr. and Mrs Wang(65), together with several of their neighbours, go to LianXiang Diner for their routine Tea Brunch. 
  These elderly people are normally the earsiest at a Tea Brunch Restaurant. 
  Their main focuses are on tea, newspapers and some morning talks. 
  Everytime the Wangs and their neighbours have their routine seats and routine table.</p>
<p>After tea is served, Mr. Wang uses tea water to clean the cups, bowls and plates and puts the waste water into the plastic box on the table. 
  This is not something particular about Mr. Wang. This is what most Tea Brunchers would normally do before they have tea.</p>
<p>Dim Sum are usually served with carts. 
  Each cart has different Dim Sum in it and the carts are pushed around the diner and around each table. 
  Mr. and Mrs. Wang do not have particular things to do, so they normally stay until 10 a.m. and leave for the grocery market.</p>
<p>With the departure of the elders come the youngers. They usually come here for family dinning or classmate gather. 
  For them, this is literally Tea Brunch. They eat much more than the elders and would stay after noon. </p>
<p>Despite of the name, Tea Brunch is much more like an "all day breakfast".
  Usually in the afternoon or at night, businessman could come with their clients and family could come with relatives. 
  With a cup of tea and several serves of Dim Sum, they could talk and enjoy the time.</p>
